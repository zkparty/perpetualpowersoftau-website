        The Privacy & Scaling Explorations team is conducting phase 1 of a multi-party trusted setup ceremony based on the Zcash Powers of Tau ceremony.
        The goal is to securely generate zk-SNARK parameters for circuits of up to 2 ^ 28 (260+ million) constraints.
        This means that the process will generate twice as many minus one (530+ million) powers of tau.

        As long as one party in the ceremony behaves honestly and is not compromised, the entire setup is trustworthy.
